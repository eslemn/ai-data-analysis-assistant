# AI-Powered Vehicle Data Analysis Assistant 🚗🤖

This project is a Python-based vehicle data analysis assistant that processes automotive datasets and generates AI-supported technical reports.

The system performs data cleaning, statistical analysis, vehicle health scoring, and produces maintenance insights using a locally running Large Language Model (LLM).

## Features

- Vehicle dataset loading and preprocessing
- Automatic missing data handling
- Statistical analysis of vehicle performance data
- Vehicle health score calculation
- AI-generated technical analysis reports
- Local LLM integration using Ollama
- Modular Python project structure

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- Local LLM integration (Ollama)
- Git & GitHub

## Example Workflow

1. Load vehicle dataset
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Perform statistical analysis
4. Calculate vehicle health score
5. Generate AI-based maintenance report

## Example Output

Vehicle Health Scores:

vehicle_id | health_score  
-----------|-------------  
1          | 100  
4          | 40  
6          | 70  

The system then generates an AI-based technical evaluation and maintenance suggestions for vehicle monitoring.

## Future Improvements

- Real-time vehicle data integration
- Dashboard visualization
- Predictive maintenance modeling
- Fleet monitoring system
- Web-based interface
